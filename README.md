# Luna's Epoc
 
When pull from repo, will need to rightclick on LunaEpoc.uproject and generate visual studio files, you'll be able to launch then from the project file without need of visual studio.

But if want to code will then need visual studio 2022 and open via the solution file (.sln) instead and launch by clicking on the Local Windows Debugger Play Icon at the top of the screen. This will attach it and launch the unreal editor. 

If not planning to do any code I recommend just launching from the uproject to save time.

The git ignore should prevent any of the Binaries/Intermediate files from being committed.

Also if want anything from Starter Content, instead of putting it in here as quite bloated, recommened creating a second project and exporting the asset you wanted.
